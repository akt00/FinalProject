# Dataset and Trained Models

I did not include the dataset and the weights of trained models in this repository due to the large file sizes. They can be downloaded from the following links.

- The original dataset can be downloaded from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mateuszbuda/lgg-mri-segmentation)
- The curated version of the dataset that I used for this project can be downloaded from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1P0lijWZ-RLjkRlJXGw9ac-2PHCQFGiAK?usp=drive_link)
- The weights of the trained models can be downloaded from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ZmDhWLdWH6V5kXV0BdmYZyCAwJhoqRMr?usp=drive_link)
- The model architectures exported to ONNX format can be downloaded from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/18dlpLAocyPUGB3zRNxAdG1hx9easCB93?usp=drive_link). Those can be used to visualize model architectures for debugging with [Netron](https://github.com/lutzroeder/netron?tab=readme-ov-file)
